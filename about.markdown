My name is **Bryan Pan**, I am a second-year Computer Science student at UCLA and I love coffee. My deep fascination with coffee has brought me here, where I write about my journey and thoughts with coffee. Whether it be the relationship between location and taste or the chemical compounds released after the roasting process, I'm continually evolving my understanding of coffee. 

**THE GROUNDS OF THE CITY** is a blog that documents my journey into coffee as I explore cafes, roasters, science and everything else coffee has to offer. Along the way, we will find hidden gems, amazing people, and nonsensical chemistry. All of this for just cup of coffee.
