I mentioned the word over-extracted earlier, and thought I should bring more context to is meaning in the world of coffee. Coffee extraction is an extremely scientific process, with different compounds breaking down at different times and conditions. While the compounds of different coffee beans might differ, the notes and tendencies of under-extracted/over-extracted coffee remain the same.

<br/>  
Under-extracted coffee tends to have sour and sharp notes. This is mainly due to the fact that the water didnâ€™t have enough time to extract the desirable sugars. We are left with a coffee that is saturated in quinic acid, lactones, and oils (mainly citrus). So we have an imbalance of acids to sugars which result in a sour coffee with a bright (acidic) finish. 
<br/>  
Over-extracted coffee tends towards a bitter and empty taste. When we over-extract coffee, not only are we extracting all the desirable sugars, but we also have moved onto complex carbohydrates and polysaccharides that end up overpowering the yummy notes from the sugars with bitter, undesirable flavors. Think about the bitterness of paper, plant fiber just doesn't taste good and those are the polysaccharides are broken down during over-extraction.
